  <p>Hello, this page will include information regarding sharks and what makes them different from one another. A table will be shown as well as a section about shark evolution and a section about different species!</p>

  <h2>Evolution of Sharks</h2>   
  <p>Sharks are very fascinating creatures with a very long history of evolution, dating back to over 400 million years. Making them one of the oldest groups of vertebrates that has been on Earth. Sharks began to evolve from early jawed fish that are known as placoderm that lived during the Devonian period. These sharks early on were pretty different from the modern ones we know, as they had boney plates instead of teeth and made a much more rigid structure. Unlike most other fish, sharks developed a skeleton made up of cartilage rather than bone. This transformation made them lighter and more agile in the water, making it more efficient when moving and hunting.</p>

  <p>But throughout history, sharks have developed several new things that have helped them survive the many environmental changes throughout the years. For example, their excellent vision, keen sense of smell, as well as their ability to detect electrical fields in the water give them an advantage over other predators.
  Over time, sharks have diversified into more than 500 species, that range from the small dwarf lanternshark to the very large whale shark. Each species has adapted to the environment it’s in, as it’s shown in different features such as size, color, and feeding patterns. Today, sharks can be found in every ocean worldwide, from coastal waters to deep in the sea. They play a very important role in the marine ecosystem as they are apex predators, helping to maintain the balance of the marine life.</p>

  <p>As a whole, sharks have evolved significantly over millions of years, acclimating to their environments while also developing unique characteristics that have kept them alive and successful predators. Their lengthy evolution highlights their resilience and purpose of life in our oceans.</p>

  <h2>Different Shark Species</h2>
  <p>Sharks are a very diverse group of fish, including over 500 species, each having unique characteristics and adaptations. Here are some of the most well-known types of sharks.</p>

  <p><strong>Great White Shark:</strong> The great white shark is one of the most known and recognized sharks, as it’s known for its large size and powerful jaws. They can grow up to 20 feet long and are found in coastal waters all around the world. They are considered apex predators and mainly feed on marine mammals and different fish.</p>

  <p><strong>Hammerhead Shark:</strong> Hammerhead sharks are distinctive for their unique head shape, which looks like a hammer. The design of their head enhances their sensory abilities, allowing them to locate their prey more effectively. They can be found often traveling in schools in warmer waters.</p>

  <p><strong>Tiger Shark:</strong> Tiger sharks are named from the stripes found on their bodies, that resemble the pattern on tiger's. They are known to have a diverse diet, including fish, seals, and even other kinds of sharks. They are located in tropical and subtropical waters.</p>

  <p><strong>Whale Shark:</strong> The whale shark is the largest fish in the ocean, as they can reach lengths of up to 40 feet long. Unlike most sharks we know, whale sharks are filter feeders, mainly consuming plankton and other small fish. They are considered gentle giants and are often located in warm waters.</p>

  <p><strong>Bull Shark:</strong> Bull sharks are one of the most unique as they have the ability to survive in both saltwater and freshwater. They are known to be aggressive and can be found in rivers, lakes, and many coastal waters. They have a very robust build and can reach up to about 11 feet long.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, sharks come in various shapes and sizes, each different to their environment. From the infamous great white to the large but gentle whale shark, each play an essential role in the marine ecosystems, showing us the incredible diversity of life that lives within our ocean.</p>
